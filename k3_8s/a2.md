##Helm install
###From Apt (Debian/Ubuntu)

Members of the Helm community have contributed a Helm package for Apt. This package is generally up to date.
````bash
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
````

###From Script
Helm now has an installer script that will automatically grab the latest version of Helm and install it locally.

You can fetch that script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.
````bash
$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod 700 get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
````
Yes, you can 
````bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash 
````
if you want to live on the edge.
